# BCPD_inhomogeneous_transcriptional_signal
The BCPD method introduced in Adams et Al 2007 is used to determine the onset of repression of a transcriptional signal imaged using the MS2-MCP system. The repression time for each singal independently is determed by the probability of having a change point denoting a sudden change in the parameters that generate the data
